12,"Once you get to a leadership role the rapid development and progress halts. There is a very strict type of person that gets to go much further then Director or VP level at AXP. The CIO and EVP are hand-in-hand the organization setters and is their way or the highway. There has been lots of attrition since these two joined the company and they have been 'cleaning house'. Most leaders can't stand them, some respect them, some 'respect' them out of fear as they wait for their options to vest. There has been a massive talent drain from AXP in the past few years and many that have left have been much more successful at other companies. I have seen Directors go to SVPs at other banks in just a few years. That is a signal of how much talent suppression goes on at AXP and many realize to get promoted or to succeed they need to leave.","There is a lot of under mgt growth available at AXP. As a technical person you can do great things, learn new technologies, get real hands on practical experience. This is a great place to groom your skills, grow your wings, and learn what you want in your career.

Feels like a slap in the face when the company literally says ""We would rather pay someone in India or the Philippines $8 an hour than pay you a decent wage"". Also, like other reviewers have stated, the environment can get a bit toxic. Not in a ""there's alt-right trolls up in here"", but more of a ""management makes incompetent decisions that makes everyone feel nervous/uneasy"". While I was there, one of my co-workers pointed out to management that the monthly performance goals seemed to be shifting based on employee performance. What this means is that management would look at the previous month's results and shift the monthly goals based on that. This would create scenarios where ""low performing employees"" who were trying to make an effort to improve their stats (harder than it sounds) would still be considered ""low performance"" and be fired with no severance or benefits. Overall it was not a happy experience.","While I worked for Amex (2010-2015) I had full benefits, plenty of vacation & sick time, and very good pay.
