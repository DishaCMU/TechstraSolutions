1,"Brand on Your Resume: After many years of losing market share and struggling to be at the front end of innovation and the fact that there's 90,000 employees, don't think MSFT is necessarily going to be attractive on your resume to more agile and smaller companies.Managing Your Career: Make you say this out loud so it registers - 90,000 employees work there. Double that for vendors. It is VERY hard to ""stand out"" and move up in the company. Don't expect your manager to be much of an advocate or enabler to help you meet your career goals - they are basically trying to survive the stack rank every year too. Not familiar with the stack rank? Check out the 2012 Vanity Fair article called ""Microsoft's Lost Decade"".","1. If you love tech, this is a great place. No doubt you'll talk tech (mostly the MSFT stack) from enterprise to consumer - from PCs to phones to Xboxes - from datacenter to desktop.2. What were GREAT benefits are now VERY GOOD (took a small step down) but still probably better than you'll find at 99% of large corporations. If you've got family - the value of the benefits is even higher. 401k match is nice.3. Even with it's struggles MSFT is still a cash printing machine. This means if you can keep your nose clean and do reasonable work, you can have a stable job, pay your bills, feed your family, and not worry (too much) about layoffs. The stock you own likely won't tank, but probably won't go up much either. You'll get a bonus each year and some stock. It's a decent life if you aren't looking to light the world on fire."," Jan 28, 2013",4.0

41,"I’m still pretty shocked at my experience since day 1. I’ll try to leave emotion out of it and share the historical events that occurred to remain truthful and not exaggerate. When I first came in as an MBA here, I was brought into my dream finance role. 24 hours after joining, my manager went on paternity leave for about 8 weeks. I heard from him a couple of times in that timeframe and that was about it. I got started working on some onboarding projects and everything was more or less fine. My office was on the other side of the building so I didn’t get to sit next to my team for the first 7 months. My teammates never really came by to say hi so it was tough to build new relationships with them, having to walk over constantly to try to connect. After my manager returned, he only talked to me a handful of times. I’d say I sat in about 8 hours worth of 1-1’s over my whole year there. I never received a performance review or feedback on a single project. I never received a quarterly or year end performance review. I never heard that I did well, but was reassured that that wasn’t my manager’s style. He’s never really one to say “good job”. Not great management. I never felt like I was wanted in that role, and I heard from numerous people that I was placed in that role by a recruiter and was never actually placed in an open role and thus I wasn’t really wanted from day 1.Now for the part that I still am just in shock around. In my organization, I was the only white person. About 3 different times, in team meetings, jokes were made about how I wouldn’t understand something or couldn’t relate because I was white and not Asian/middle eastern. I just brushed it off and laughed, but felt like I experienced a form of racism that I had never felt before. Having not felt like part of the team ever and then had them make jokes about my race at my expense... it really didn’t feel good. But, because I’m Caucasian and not something else, if never felt like I could say anything about it because it’s Seattle and many people believe racism against Caucasian people isn’t possible. I would disagree based on my experience.At the end of my time, after declaring I was leaving, I never heard from a single HR rep. I had so much I needed to share and I didn’t even get an email about my departure. Nothing. Zero. No form of exit interview. No goodbye. Nothing. So now I’m sharing this all here because I didn’t get to share it internally. It was the strangest exit I’ve ever had.The moral is: people leave managers, not companies. Microsoft is a spectacular company, but my management experience was really, really poor and HR really dropped the ball here. I was so sad too having come into my dream job and feeling unwanted completely from day 1. I would’ve stayed if even one person showed that they cared in the least. I had shared this with multiple friends there on my last day who had been there for years and they were in utter disgust and shocked that HR had never reached out. They reached out on my behalf and even that didn’t trigger a response.I’m just really shocked and sad. I was really excited to build a career at Microsoft and chose to leave due to this experience.","Satya Nadella is a truly spectacular leader, as well as Phil Spencer. I honestly loved working for both of them and knew that what I was contributing to was an inspiring vision and mission! The benefits at Microsoft are outstanding, the events are a blast and are a fantastic motivator throughout the year , the opportunities for growth and diversity in your job... some of the best I’ve ever seen. Microsoft also is in a serious growth phase so it’s an exciting time to be a part of the organization!"," Sep 15, 2018",2.0
