33,"The inadequate training will make you feel extremely bombarded, stressed consistently and will make you feel absolutely stupid once you hit the floor. They give you 10 weeks of training, but tell you it will take approximately 18-24 months before you'll feel comfortable in your role. Clients on the phone expect you to understand your software, and understand the round abouts of payroll. Consistently asking for help to answer questions clients have, while placing them on 2-3 minute holds 3 to 4 times per call. Client retention is difficult because 5 star client service is difficult whenever 90% of your colleagues are new and don't understand the product. While I did my best, my mental health took a toll and I found myself on medication attempting to stay afloat. 45+ hour work weeks in the winter time, and don't expect to ever be off work when your scheduled, a client will keep you on the phone well after.

81,"Senior leadership is not transparent, you are labeled (branding)I started off thinking this would be a great place to work but that quickly changed. There is no training in ANY departments but you are expected to learn your role and be successful. If not, you will be fired with no regret. All the other locations were closed and everything came to Norfolk but training sucks. You spend your day trying to find answers. Managers are not given the help they need to help their teams so they too are stressed and confused. The roles changes and more responsibilities were placed on employees and we were told to just accept it. I had to work at home EVERY day after work to try to catchup so there is no worklife balance. ADP asks new people to take these surveys when they first start, when its 'happy times' but once we go through the useless training, we see the real picture. I use to recommend people to ADP but I would not recommend anyone going to ADP because everyone keeps leaving so everyone continues to be new so who are the resources? I was warned from a friend in another state that the company was chaotic. I should have listened. My friend still there has been there for 6 months and is leaving soon.
