0,"Highmark is going through a large transformation - and with a large transformation, comes significant change. It can be difficult to continually challenge the norm and status quo and best for those that like a challenge.","I have been with Highmark for almost 10 years and hope to spend 10+ more. I came as an individual contributor and have continued to grow in span and scope of control every 12-18 months. I am continually impressed by how smart, driven, and supportive my colleagues are. One of the things I particularly appreciate is the number of women leaders in senior positions and have created real personal friendships with my colleagues outside of work."," Sep 12, 2018",5.0

28,"Speaking of heath/well-being, it's quite ironic that working in health insurance is when you can surely expect to suffer the most physical and mental anguish of your life (if you're in the wrong department, I cannot speak for everywhere.) I cannot even begin to put my misery into real words. I used to cry almost everyday after working as hard as I could all day because of the amount of tension and stress in the office. I am at a new job now, also in a big corporate setting, but it's light-years better. I often feel like I just got out of an abusive relationship and I am still adjusting to normalcy. I could list endless examples but I would just say to take my word for it and the other negative reviews too. ALL OF THE GOOD REVIEWS ON HERE LOOK FAKE OR SEEM TO BE COMING FROM THE FEW AREAS THAT AREN'T AS MISERABLE.","If you're in a super-specialized position/department, perhaps your life won't be as miserable as ours was. I can't even really name any pros that outweigh the cons, it's just not worth it.

31,"- There are locations in India, and a lot of the jobs are being sent there, which means ""positions are being eliminated here. Please google this, and you will see this is true- Terrible corporate culture - everyone walks around scared they're going to lose their job- Work hours - you're told it's a 40 hour position. That's a lie. They want you to put in extra hours, and not just a few here and there. Expect to work 50-60 a week sometimes- They will lowball you an offer, so do not accept the first one if you want to work here. They have a bracket which gives a scale on the pay. You should go for at least the middle. If you do not they company will strickly tell you when you get an internal promotion that they can only go up to a 7 percent raise, or the minimum of the grade in which you took the new position. This is untrue. If HR tells you this, ask to speak to the hiring manager. The hiring manager has the final say","Benefits are great. Decently priced health insurance, company 401 is comparable to other companies. They match up to 3% and then they match 1/2 a percent on the next two percent. You can move up relatively quickly, but it's all a game on ""who you know."" Make sure to be friends with management, or you will sit in your current position."," Jan 24, 2018",2.0

33,"Amazing lack of oversight and governance. Knowledge throughout the organization is fractured and poorly dispersed. Managers at directors level and above are out of touch with reality and ultimately overpaid charlatans lacking innovation, strategy or direction. The company benefits immensely by the inelastic demand for health care and the nonprofit structure of its insurance business. Prior to starting with Highmark, I had a negative image of healthcare insurers and sadly, the negativity of my image has only worsened. The bloat in this company is intense and too often the operational aspects of the business screams excess and wasteful. It continues to astonish me how a company such as this, one that is simply a middle man between patients and actual providers of healthcare, can gouge so many while offering no true or necessary product. Their existence is predicated on their ability to draw pricing power to lower cost, yet in reality, the greatest pricing power would be that of the largest possible pool of insurable people (ie the entire nation or a single payer).","WFH, On-site gym, good co-workers"," Feb 9, 2018",1.0
